# ENCRYPTIX---ML_intern
Encryptix Internship Program - Machine Learning
<br>
TASK 1 - A machine learning model that can predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. Made using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines.
<br>
Task 2 - A model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Used a dataset containing information about credit card transactions, and experimented with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.
<br>
TASK 3 - A model to predict customer churn for a subscription based service or business. Used historical customer data, including features like usage behavior and customer demographics, and tried algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting to predict churn.
<br>
TASK 4 - An AI model that can classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate. Used techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines to identify spam messages.
<br>
TASK 5 - Implemented a character-level recurrent neural network (RNN) to generate handwritten-like text. Trained the model on a dataset of handwritten text examples, and it generates new text based on the learned patterns.
